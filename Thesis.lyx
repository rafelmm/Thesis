\begin_layout Subsection
Field of application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project relates to an industrial monitoring system.
 More specifically the main application of the developed device is to monitor,
 in real time, the position of a point machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A point machine is an electric motor driven switch that enables an operator
 to switch a train from one railroad track to another.
 The main elements of a switch are the points.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:points_railroad_switch"

\end_inset

 shows the points in the normal position (top) and in the reverse position
 (bottom).
 When the points are in normal position the train, which goes from left
 to right in this diagram, continues by the same track.
 In the other hand, when the points are in reverse position the train changes
 from one track to another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nowadays point machines are typically operated from a remote location.
 Because their closure is imperative it has a device to inform the operator
 about its current position.
 The most common realization of this device consists on two locking bars
 or detector bars, as we can see in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:point_machine_parts"

\end_inset

.
 The motor is connected to the strecher (or trhow bar) through gears.
 At the other end of the bar there are two points, or switch rails, attached
 to it.
 Each point has a locking bar attached to it.
 These locking bars go from the points to the engine closing.
 In the engine side there are two two holding elements, called hammers,
 which are used to lock the locking bars.
 Each locking bar has a notch that allows the hammer to lock it in the current
 position.
 When the points are in normal position the first hammer locks one bar and
 when the points are in reverse position the second hammer locks the other
 bar.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:point_machine_parts"

\end_inset

 shows a real point machine engine.
 We can see locking hammers are one in front of the other and the locking
 bars are one above the other.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:martillos_con_holguras"

\end_inset

 shows a detail of the hammers and the notch in the locking bars.
 Images are taken at different time instants and at different positions
 of the point machine.
 In the image on the left the hammer on the top fits the notch of one locking
 bar.
 In the other position, the hammer in the bottom fits the notch of the other
 bar.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the operator moves the motor causes the linear and perpendicular movement
 of the drive bar.
 In turn, this causes the points to move and change their position.
 The points drag the locking bars which they are attached to.
 Inside of the engine housing, the hammer locks the locking bar corresponding
 to the side where the points are.
 This produces an electric signal that informs the remote operator that
 the switch has been successfully completed.
 When the locking bar does not arrive to its final position the electric
 circuit remains opened so the position of the switch is unknown and the
 operator cannot operate the switch.
 Security rules establish that a train cannot pass trough an intersection
 where the point machine is in an unknown position.
 This affects directly the railway traffic in a high demand network like
 a subway or the suburban train.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the position of the point machine is the only information required
 from the point of view of railway safety it is not enough from the point
 of view of the maintenance of a big number of point machines.
 There exists devices like the one described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-US6382567"

\end_inset

 which uses inductive proximity sensors or 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-US6427949"

\end_inset

 which uses a transformer with two coils to detect the position of the bar.
 There exists another device researched by the UPC and developed by Thinking
 Foward XXI SL that monitors all the signals available in the point machine
 including the exact position of the lock bars.
 This device is part of a system that will be further explained in chapter

\begin_layout Subsection
Goal
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Goal"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the present project is to develop a device to monitor the exact
 position of the lock bars.
 The task of the monitoring device can be divided in two sub-tasks.
 The first one consists in detecting the position of the point machine,
 this is, which lock bar is currently locked.
 The second one consists on measuring the real gap between the lock bar
 notch and the lock blade as we can see in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

There are some requisites that this device has to accomplish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Easiness to install.
 In the railway sector there is very limited period of time to do the maintenanc
e tasks during the night where there is no operation of the service, therefore
 it is very important that the developed device to be very easy and quick
 to install.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Robustness.
 Sometimes point machines are in the exterior subject to bad weather, dust
 and humidity.
 Although the device will be installed inside of the motor housing it has
 to be robust to this unfavorable conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Precision.
 It is very important that the developed solution gives exact measurements
 with high repetitiveness.
 The gap to be measured in the lock bar is of few millimeters, so the desired
 precision of the measurements is between 0.1mm and 0.5mm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reduced execution time.
 As it will be explained in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Design"

\end_inset

 there are two modes of operation.
 In normal operation there is a window of 10 seconds to give the measure.
 In continuous operation the device has to be able to give at least one
 measure per second.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reduced manufacturing costs.
 In a railway infraestructure are hundreds of engines to monitor, therefore,
 the unit price of the monitoring device must be low.
 The system should reduce the cost of infraestructure maintenance.
 Potential customers of the system are public or semi-public companies so
 the budget is considered at most for four years.
 All investments must have its pay-back less than this period of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will have these points in mind in order to do the design of the device
 in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Design"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\end_inset

 shows a summary of the Gantt Chart of the project and figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tasks"

\end_inset

 shows a more detailed planning of the phases and tasks.
 There are 5 people in the design and development team.
 This has been taking into account to establish the duration and planning
 of the tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Projects where both, hardware and software, are involved are very hard to
 plan because sometimes there are several iterations in the hardware design.
 At the beginning of this project there is a first prototype with a basic
 functionality that consists on taking pictures and sending them to the
 Server.
 I have been involved in the hardware design, schematic and layout, and
 also in the firmware development of this prototype.
 Because of this, the planning of this project is more realistic and the
 hardware design is shorter than in other projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All members of the team are multidisciplinary but mainly the hardware team
 includes 3 people and the software and firmware team consists on 2 people.
 My tasks are mainly in the software and firmware development although as
 I have previously explained I have also been involved in the hardware developme
nt of the prototype which will be taken as the starting point of the final
 device.
 In order to make it more clear, I have marked in red the tasks where I
 will be actively involved in figure

Computer vision in industrial applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computer vision is becoming widely used in industry and many applications
 have appeared in recent years because it enables the automation of a wide
 range of processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Industrial computer vision applications can be classified in two groups.
 The first and most extended one consists on using computer vision to visual
 inspection.
 We can find many examples in the literature that uses image processing
 for this purpose.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-Automated-IC-Manufacture"

\end_inset

 a method for locating and inspecting integrated circuit chips is described.
 Another application consists on automatic verification of the quality of
 printed circuit boards like in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-Visual-Inspection-PCB"

\end_inset

, fabric quality 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "key-Detection-Fabric-Defects"

\end_inset

 or industrial plastic components 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-Automatic-Q-Control-Products"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second group comprise the control of robots by artificial vision systems.
 One example of this application is robot guidance to a precise position
 or trajectory planning like in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-Robot-guidance"

\end_inset

 and obstacle avoidance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-spray-painting"

\end_inset

 a more sophisticated method of an industrial application with two CCD sensors
 for spray painting of a general three dimensional surface is described.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "measurement-leaf-plant"

\end_inset

 a measurement technique using computer vision is described.
 We will explain a little more this article because it relates more directly
 to the task that we want to perform in this project.
 The goal of the work presented in this article is to measure area of leafs.
 In order to do so, the fist step consists on obtaining binary images performing
 a segmentation of color images with an Otsu approach using the hue information.
 Otsu gives the optimal gray level in the range of [0,255] for image binarizatio
n.
 This will be further explained in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Fundamentals"

\end_inset

.
 Due to some colors in background are close to the color of the leafs noise
 appears in the binary image.
 An opening is applied in the binary image to delete this kind of noise.
 Once they have filtered binary images they look for connected components
 using a two-scan algorithm.
 After the labeling step they use geometric characteristics of the a leaf
 in order to filter residual noise.
 Finally they count the foreground pixels and multiply this number by a
 precomputed constant to compute the leaf area.
 This constant is initialized with a calibration card of a known area.
 Similarly in this project we will follow more or less the same strategy
 to determine the exact position of the lock bar as it will be explained
 in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Design"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Embedded computer vision
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of image processing require lots of memory resources and processor
 time a variety of applications are still using ordinary computers to perform
 these tasks.
 Some examples are video surveillance applications, car license plate number
 identification, face recognition applications, etc.
 Another approach is to use an embedded system for this kind of applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:embedded-system"

\end_inset

 shows a diagram of an embedded system.
 It consists mainly of an image sensor, some signal processing Integrated
 Circuit (IC) like an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Digital
 Signal Processor (DSP), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Micro Controller
 Unit (MCU) or Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) and optionally some
 external memory, other sensors, communications IC and interfaces.
 The only part of the different approaches that can be changed is the signal
 processing unit.

\begin_layout Standard
The main advantage of this type of systems is that they are smaller than
 the computer approach so they can be installed in many other places.
 The drawbacks are the constraints in power consumption, memory, and processing
 speed.
 The emergence of more powerful microprocessors and microcontrollers has
 led to the gradual appearance of embedded systems for image processing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "embedded-CV-measurement"

\end_inset

 an image sensor, a MCU and some laser diodes are used to measure object
 dimensions.
 They use an object with known dimension to calibrate the system and translate
 pixel information extracted from the laser lines in the image to real dimension
s of the object.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "embedded-fingerprint"

\end_inset

 the authors have developed and embedded system based on a DSP to do fingerprint
 detection.
 The fingerprint database is stored in an external SDRAM memory.
 They also uses a keyboard and a display as the human machine interface.
 Another application of embedded systems can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "embedded-car-plate"

\end_inset

.
 This application consists on finding and recognizing car license plate
 numbers.
 An ARM processor is the core of this system that also contains an external
 memory, a keyboard, an LCD and different communications interfaces.
 In this application there are two different tasks.
 The first one consists on locating the car plate in the image.
 If this task is successful they extract the characters and perform a single-cha
racter processing to recognize the license number.
 Finally the recognized license number is shown in an LCD.
 Finally, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "embedded-realtime-face"

\end_inset

 an embedded system has been developed for face detection.
 In this approach authors use an FPGA as the core of the system.
 FPGA provides higher computational power but in the other hand they are
 much more expensive than MCU or DSP.

\begin_layout Subsection
System specifications (according to the goals)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The device must be designed taking into account the goals stated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Goal"

\end_inset

 and the size constraints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
First of all the device must be easy to install.
 There are only 3 daily hours to perform the maintenance tasks and maintenance
 teams are small according to the size of the infraestructure to maintain.
 The most easy to install the device the better.
 This should be taken into account in the hardware, specially in the box
 design, and in the firmware design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The device needs to be robust in two senses.
 The first one relates directly with the hardware design because it has
 to be installed inside a point machine which is subject to vibration, temperatu
re changes, dust and humidity.
 The box of the device must resists this unfavourable conditions.
 The other sense refers to the repeatability and confidence of the measurements
 and it is related with the software design and implementation.
 The error rate of the device should be less than 5%, including bad measures
 and unknown measures when the lock bar is in its correct position.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The minimum total gap to measure is of 5 milimeters.
 Maintenance operators want to know where the gap i less than 10% in order
 to plan a task to correct the position of the bars.
 The precision of the measurement should be less than 0.5mm and it is desirable
 to be 0.25mm.
 This should be taken into account to determine the resolution of the CCD
 and image processing algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Another constraint of the system is the execution time that consists on
 the image capture plus the image processing times.
 The image capture time is determined by the hardware (the image sensor,
 the microcontroller and the memory latency).
 The image algorithm determines the processing time.
 As it has been explained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Goal"

\end_inset

 the device has to two modes of operation.
 In normal operation it gives a measure every 10 seconds.
 In general, the execution time could be up to 10 seconds.
 In continuous operation the device must provide at leas one measure per
 second.
 This has to be considered in the design of the image processing algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Power consumption has also be taken into account.
 The wire length between the control cabin and the point machine location
 can sometimes be quite long, up to 1Km.
 The device is powerd by a DC voltage up to 24V with a cable of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.5mm^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The resistivity of the copper is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho=R\frac{S}{l}=1.71\times10^{-8}\Omega m
\]

\end_inset

as we can see in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wiki:resistividad"

\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is the section of the conductor in squared meters and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 is the wire length in meters.
 We can compute the total wire resistence as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R=\rho\frac{l}{S}=11.86\Omega
\]

\end_inset

 If we take, for instance, that the device consumes 150mA, the total drop
 of potential at the device is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E=I\times2R=3,56V
\]

\end_inset

Tipically the same cable is used to power more than one device so the power
 consumption represents a constraint on the design.
 This constraint relates not only with the hardware but also with the firmware
 of the device.
 If the execution time is so long that the device is always running then
 the power consumption increases and it probably does not fullfill the power
 consumption constraint.
\end_layout
