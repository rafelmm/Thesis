\begin_layout Subsection
Field of application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project relates to an industrial monitoring system.
 More specifically the main application of the developed device is to monitor,
 in real time, the position of a point machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A point machine is an electric motor driven switch that enables an operator
 to switch a train from one railroad track to another.
 The main elements of a switch are the points.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:points_railroad_switch"

\end_inset

 shows the points in the normal position (top) and in the reverse position
 (bottom).
 When the points are in normal position the train, which goes from left
 to right in this diagram, continues by the same track.
 In the other hand, when the points are in reverse position the train changes
 from one track to another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nowadays point machines are typically operated from a remote location.
 Because their closure is imperative it has a device to inform the operator
 about its current position.
 The most common realization of this device consists on two lock bars, as
 we can see in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:point_machine_parts"

\end_inset

.
 The motor is connected to the drive bar through gears.
 At the other end of the bar there are two points, or switch rails, attached
 to it.
 Each point has a lock bar attached to it.
 These lock bars go from the points to the engine.
 In the engine side there are two lock blades, one for each bar.
 When the points are in normal position the first lock blade locks one bar
 and when the points are in reverse position the second lock blade locks
 the other bar.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the operator moves the motor causes the linear and perpendicular movement
 of the drive bar.
 In turn, this causes the points to move and change their position.
 The points drag the lock bars which they are attached to.
 Inside of the engine housing, the lock blade locks the lock bar corresponding
 to the side where the points are.
 This produces an electric signal that informs the remote operator that
 the switch has been successfully completed.
 When the lock bar does not arrive to its final position the electric circuit
 remains opened so the position of the switch is unknown and the operator
 cannot operate the switch.
 Security rules establish that a train cannot pass trough an intersection
 where the point machine is in an unknown position.
 This affects directly the railway traffic in a high demand network like
 a subway or the suburban train.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the position of the point machine is the only information required
 from the point of view of railway safety it is not enough from the point
 of view of the maintenance of a big number of point machines.
 There exists devices like the one described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-US6382567"

\end_inset

 which uses inductive proximity sensors or 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-US6427949"

\end_inset

 which uses a transformer with two coils to detect the position of the bar.
 There exists another device researched by the UPC and developed by Thinking
 Foward XXI SL that monitors all the signals available in the point machine
 including the exact position of the lock bars.
 This device is part of a system that will be further explained in chapter
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Prior-Art"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Goal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the present project is to develop a device to monitor the exact
 position of the lock bars.
 Furthermore there are some requisites that this device has to accomplish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Easiness to install.
 In the railway sector there is very limited period of time to do the maintenanc
e tasks during the night where there is no operation of the service, therefore
 it is very important that the developed device to be very easy and quick
 to install.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Robustness.
 Sometimes point machines are in the exterior subject to bad weather, dust
 and humidity.
 Although the device will be installed inside of the motor housing it has
 to be robust to this unfavorable conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Precision.
 It is very important that the developed solution gives exact measurements
 with high repetitiveness.
 The gap to be measured in the lock bar is of few millimeters, so the desired
 precision of the measurements is between 0.1mm and 0.5mm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reduced execution time.
 As it will be explained in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Design"

\end_inset

 there are two modes of operation.
 In normal operation there is a window of 10 seconds to give the measure.
 In continuous operation the device has to be able to give at least one
 measure per second.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will have these points in mind in order to do the design of the device
 in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Design"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Planning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows a summary of the Gantt Chart of the project and figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:tasks"

\end_inset

 shows a more detailed planning of the phases and tasks.
 There are 5 people in the design and development team.
 This has been taking into account to establish the duration and planning
 of the tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Projects where both, hardware and software, are involved are very hard to
 plan because sometimes there are several iterations in the hardware design.
 At the beginning of this project there is a first prototype with a basic
 functionality that consists on taking pictures and sending them to the
 Server.
 I have been involved in the hardware design, schematic and layout, and
 also in the firmware development of this prototype.
 Because of this, the planning of this project is more realistic and the
 hardware design is shorter than in other projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All members of the team are multidisciplinary but mainly the hardware team
 includes 3 people and the software and firmware team consists on 2 people.
 My tasks are mainly in the software and firmware development although as
 I have previously explained I have also been involved in the hardware developme
nt of the prototype which will be taken as the starting point of the final
 device.
 In order to make it more clear, I have marked in red the tasks where I
 will be actively involved in figure

\begin_layout Subsection
Computer vision in industrial applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computer vision is becoming widely used in industry and many applications
 have appeared in recent years because it enables the automation of a wide
 range of processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Industrial computer vision applications can be classified in two groups.
 The first and most extended one consists on using computer vision to visual
 inspection.
 We can find many examples in the literature that uses image processing
 for this purpose.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-Automated-IC-Manufacture"

\end_inset

 a method for locating and inspecting integrated circuit chips is described.
 Another application consists on automatic verification of the quality of
 printed circuit boards like in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-Visual-Inspection-PCB"

\end_inset

, fabric quality 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-Detection-Fabric-Defects"

\end_inset

 or industrial plastic components 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-Automatic-Q-Control-Products"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second group comprise the control of robots by artificial vision systems.
 One example of this application is robot guidance to a precise position
 or trajectory planning like in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-Robot-guidance"

\end_inset

 and obstacle avoidance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-obstacle-avoidance"

\end_inset

.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-spray-painting"

\end_inset

 a more sophisticated method of an industrial application with two CCD sensors
 for spray painting of a general three dimensional surface is described.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "measurement-leaf-plant"

\end_inset

 a measurement technique using computer vision is described.
 We will explain a little more this article because it relates more directly
 to the task that we want to perform in this project.
 The goal of the work presented in this article is to measure area of leafs.
 In order to do so, the fist step consists on obtaining binary images performing
 a segmentation of color images with an Otsu approach using the hue information.
 Otsu gives the optimal gray level in the range of [0,255] for image binarizatio
n.
 This will be further explained in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Fundamentals"

\end_inset

.
 Due to some colors in background are close to the color of the leafs noise
 appears in the binary image.
 An opening is applied in the binary image to delete this kind of noise.
 Once they have filtered binary images they look for connected components
 using a two-scan algorithm.
 After the labeling step they use geometric characteristics of the a leaf
 in order to filter residual noise.
 Finally they count the foreground pixels and multiply this number by a
 precomputed constant to compute the leaf area.
 This constant is initialized with a calibration card of a known area.
 Similarly in this project we will follow more or less the same strategy
 to determine the exact position of the lock bar as it will be explained
 in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Design"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Embedded computer vision
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of image processing require lots of memory resources and processor
 time a variety of applications are still using ordinary computers to perform
 these tasks.
 Some examples are video surveillance applications, car license plate number
 identification, face recognition applications, etc.
 Another approach is to use an embedded system for this kind of applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:embedded-system"

\end_inset

 shows a diagram of an embedded system.
 It consists mainly of an image sensor, some signal processing Integrated
 Circuit (IC) like an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Digital
 Signal Processor (DSP), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Micro Controller
 Unit (MCU) or Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) and optionally some
 external memory, other sensors, communications IC and interfaces.
 The only part of the different approaches that can be changed is the signal
 processing unit.

\begin_layout Standard
The main advantage of this type of systems is that they are smaller than
 the computer approach so they can be installed in many other places.
 The drawbacks are the constraints in power consumption, memory, and processing
 speed.
 The emergence of more powerful microprocessors and microcontrollers has
 led to the gradual appearance of embedded systems for image processing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "embedded-CV-measurement"

\end_inset

 an image sensor, a MCU and some laser diodes are used to measure object
 dimensions.
 They use an object with known dimension to calibrate the system and translate
 pixel information extracted from the laser lines in the image to real dimension
s of the object.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "embedded-fingerprint"

\end_inset

 the authors have developed and embedded system based on a DSP to do fingerprint
 detection.
 The fingerprint database is stored in an external SDRAM memory.
 They also uses a keyboard and a display as the human machine interface.
 Another application of embedded systems can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "embedded-car-plate"

\end_inset

.
 This application consists on finding and recognizing car license plate
 numbers.
 An ARM processor is the core of this system that also contains an external
 memory, a keyboard, an LCD and different communications interfaces.
 In this application there are two different tasks.
 The first one consists on locating the car plate in the image.
 If this task is successful they extract the characters and perform a single-cha
racter processing to recognize the license number.
 Finally the recognized license number is shown in an LCD.
 Finally, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "embedded-realtime-face"

\end_inset

 an embedded system has been developed for face detection.
 In this approach authors use an FPGA as the core of the system.
 FPGA provides higher computational power but in the other hand they are
 much more expensive than MCU or DSP.
